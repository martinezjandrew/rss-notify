# rss-notify

Schedule system notifications for your favorite RSS feeds!

Created by: Andrew Martinez

## Description

rss-notify is a Rust program that runs as a background daemon and sends system notifications for the latest items from your chosen RSS feeds, according to a schedule you define.

## Status

Currently in a **proof-of-concept** state. This version can fetch the latest item from the Arch-Wiki News RSS feed and display it as a system notification. Future versions will support multiple feeds, custom schedules, and more advanced features.

## Features (Planned)

- Support for multiple RSS feeds
- Configurable notification schedule
- Cross-platform system notifications
- Option to mark items as read or ignored
